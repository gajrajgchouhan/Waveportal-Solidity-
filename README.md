# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# buildspace

Now we need to actually

1. Compile it.
2. Deploy it to our local blockchain.
3. Once it's there, that `console.log` will run :).
   We need to do this because in the real world, smart contracts live on the blockchain. And, we want our website and smart contract to be used by real people so they can ðŸ‘‹ at us or do whatever you want them to do!
